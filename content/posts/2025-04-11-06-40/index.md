I have a huge blister on my hand and apparently it snowed??<!--more-->

It's so common for climbers to get callouses on their hands, and after climbing
I often have redness at the top of each finger "pad" where the skin gets pinched
during climbs. One of those spots, right before the first knuckle of my right
ring finger, has developed into a blister.

I don't usually get blisters, which I guess is lucky for me, but this time I was
not so lucky. I noticed that the pain of bending that finger was persisting
longer than usual; typically that irritated area stops hurting after the first
day, but this one kept hurting and seemed to hurt more.

This morning I looked at it and... Yup, full of fluid. Lovely.

I'm not sure what to do, I can probably leave it alone and see if it heals, but
that could take several days. I could try to drain it, or I could go to the
walk-in clinic and see if they can drain it for me. Neither of those options
really sounds fun.

My two buds whom I sometimes climb with on Friday nights suggested going today,
but now I'm not sure if I ought to with this blister right here. I may just see
how everything feels after a day of work.

Apparently it *snowed* last night?? Not a lot, maybe 1/4 of an inch, but it's 33
degrees and I think it's actively raining right now. So gross!

It's typical of New England to give us one beautiful, 65-degree sunny day, and
then flip around and snow on us.
