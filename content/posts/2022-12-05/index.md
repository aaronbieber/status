It was a mixed bag of a day. Maybe I say that because I fail to make plans and
therefore feel unsure about whether the day was "a success," which seems like
something to reflect on in general.

I did manage to crank out a few things from the backlog, so it isn't for
nothing. I also had a coaching exchange that went well, though it wasn't a great
source of feedback for me. It helped my exchange coachee, though, and that's
what really matters in the end.

I managed to get myself embroiled in research about this Eufy camera scandal
that has been unfolding. A security researcher found some troubling gaps in
their implementation and a couple examples of how they really violated their own
marketing statements, from which I'm sure there will be a class action brought
against them. Dumped way too much time into that and didn't learn a ton.

My guest post is basically done. The newsletter author left edits, which were
minor, so I think it's essentially in a place we can both live with, and I look
forward to crossing that off of my list of things to do.

One of my current clients committed to posting something on LinkedIn for me, and
another prospect posted last week. Always nice to have those floating around out
there.

The goal for December is to have a concrete strategy and some content developed
for meeting more people "face to face" (probably in Meet/Zoom, in
reality). Right now this is looking like some kind of workshop or active
learning group and I just need to figure out what topic to try. I have an
inkling so I'm going to work on developing that tomorrow.

Just a couple more weeks till Christmas, which is ridiculous.
