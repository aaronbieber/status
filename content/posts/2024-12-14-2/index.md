Solo book club: Vertical Mind (ch. 4-8)<!--more-->

I did not write out book club posts as I've been reading at random times and
apparently I made a lot of progress without really reflecting on it, so this is
going to be a whirlwind. The chapters here are:

* 4: Fear and Performance
* 5: The Fear of Falling
* 6: Falling and Relaxation Drills and Tactics
* 7: Fear of Failure
* 8: Drills and Tactics to Address Fear of Failure

As you can see, they are all related to fears and how to address or manage them.
I think I can summarize what I took away from all four chapters in a holistic
way so that's what I'm going to attempt to do.

The generalized point is that our performance in climbing is hindered by our
fears. The fear of falling can be legitimate and helpful (because it may shield
us from injury), but it can also be detrimental (when we hold ourselves back
because of the fear itself). The fear of failure is a more obvious waste of
energy, and when we are in fear of what others think about us it can hold us
back from reaching our potential.

Different people react differently to being watched; I think I mostly climb
harder when I'm being watched, but I think I also fear what it means to fall or
fail on a climb, especially if it is one that others in my group have sent. A
thrust of the book is to detach yourself from that thinking and consider only
your own goals.

The most interesting things I recall from the falling chapters were related to
strategies for evaluating fall risk, which include throwing sandbags to test the
strength of a flake, or watch another person take a fall you're nervous about.
Those may come in handy as I begin to lead climb. The latter one, anyway.

There was a lot of space devoted to a risk analysis framework, which to me felt
so obvious I didn't derive a ton of utility from it, but it's nonetheless useful
to consider whether a fall is "worth it."

Finally there is the chapter entirely about relaxation, which I think mainly is
concerned with observing when you need to "amp up" vs. relax, and provides some
ideas for how to do that. Before doing a tough dyno, you might want to give a
"primal scream," and if you're overgripping and getting anxious you might want
to do a breathing technique.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly for me personally, is the tactics to
manage fear of failure. I don't necessarily have a strong "fear" of failure, but
I think I do fail to frame success in a way that fits my progress goals and
gives me the space to climb the way I want to climb. That is, it's easy to say
"failure is not sending," or "success is sending," and people may superficially
think about climbing that way, but as with any sport, there is more to it than
winning and losing.

Moreover, and what I think is the big point here, thinking about success in a
more nuanced way (and independent from sending or making the goal or winning the
game) is the gateway to making progress in performance. Because if you are only
fixated on that end goal, you won't be able to measure and adapt the real
actions you take during the climb (or game or whatever).

Chapter eight offers a bunch of specific scenarios or common ways of thinking
about failure and success, and ways to debunk those ideas or re-script them to
be more beneficial. I don't remember much of what I took away from those, it all
seemed logical to me.

What is more useful is how I want to apply this in my climbing, and I think
there's definitely something there about how to frame what my goal is, and how I
*feel* about my performance, regardless of whether I send a climb or not. Did I
try as hard as I could? Did I learn anything? Did I make any progress on the climb?

We are social creatures and have very deeply hardwired emotions attached to
where we think we fall in the social order, or how we think we are accepted by
others. This is one of those "lizard brain" self-defense mechanisms because
humans who didn't have others to help them basically died. It makes sense from
that perspective, but when it comes to these big-brain industrialized society
hobbies like recreational rock climbing, we can be holding ourselves back by
ascribing too much to those feelings.

What I need to work on is being happy to fall off a climb that other people
completed, because I unlocked something for myself, or because I just had fun.
Everyone has good days and bad days on the wall, and there's no reason to dwell
on each send in that way. We'll all tick our projects eventually, if we keep at
it. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

I think that's enough for these chapters.
