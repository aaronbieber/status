I think it's mostly in my head, but I feel like I've run out of spoons. I think
it's the solo dadding, or maybe I'm making excuses, but I couldn't see clear to
get much done today.

I wrote the monthly update email to my "personal board of directors," poked at a
guest post on a colleague's blog that I'm actually excited to write
(conceptually, anyway), and joined the Coaching from Essence "master coaching
intensive."

That "intensive" session continues to bear fruit. It's a great group of people
at different stages in practice development and all generally motivated and
seemingly good-hearted, which is a tricky combination to find sometimes.

From this session, I elected to remove the pricing from my website. I will also
rewrite it to orient around a minimum 3-month engagement length.

But that's a triviality. The important take-away is that I am not really
speaking to the audience I want to speak to in my writing. I mean, I am, sort
of, but I need to speak *directly* to the *very specific* people who are going
to get the most value from what I'm doing, and have the most at stake.

Those people are senior managers, VPEs, CTOs. What are *their* biggest problems?
Where do they hang out? Where can I find a bunch of CTOs cheaply, and in
abundance?

If you know, please write.

In the meantime, I'm going to go try to find out.
