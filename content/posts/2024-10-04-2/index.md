Reflecting on the ride; MXXN has arrived; a fire is happening.

Should the posts from today be sorted chronologically? Maybe it seems a little
off that it goes backwards, but then again if you landed here from a social post
you'd probably want to see the newest one that you clicked on? Who knows. Nobody
reads this anyway.

### Bikes

We did the 20-mile ride, and I'd say overall it went off very well. It's
challenging; the first few miles is rough but once we're warmed up it feels
fine, and the whole first half was smooth.

We stopped at a park at about 11 miles and ate our lunch, and then getting back
on the trail it felt like we were completely starting over. But after about 15
minutes of that, we both got warmed up again and felt fine. Toward the very end,
I started to feel muscle pain again, but this is probably because I am
under-trained.

What a beautiful day for a ride, too. I wore a light jacket at the start and
took it off maybe five miles in. It was great to be able to exercise the
pannier bags that are normally stowed in zippered pouches on the trunk bags. No
problem to carry a lunch and a jacket and my camera, bike lock, etc.

### MXXN

After hearing about this from work I impulse-bought a bottle of MXXN, which they
describe as "cannabis-infused non-alcoholic spirits." Personally, I don't think
you can call something that is non-alcoholic a "spirit," but whatever.

This is one of these products that walks through a 28-billion-dollar-sized
loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill, which allows for cultivation of hemp cannabis
and extraction of cannabinoids provided that the THC level specifically is below
0.3% (by weight, I think?)

I believe that the THC that you get out of hemp is "delta-8 THC" which is a
lower potency than what you get in adult-use cannabis products ("delta-9 THC"),
but in many ways it's the same thing.

Anyway, we're gonna find out, because I now have 750ml of "Kentucky
bourbon"-flavored (well, allegedly) MXXN.

They say MXXN is pronounced "moon," but I reject the notion that anyone can
simply rewrite the rules of English pronunciation at a whim, so I'm going to
pronounce it "mixin'," which is what it should have been anyway.

### Fire, good! Napster, bad!

I successfully talked the wife into doing a dinnertime fire pit, so this is
happening. I might even bust out the hammocks. A fire and a hammock sounds
pretty awesome, I gotta say.

We got some hot dogs and some macaroni salad, it's going to be a good time!
