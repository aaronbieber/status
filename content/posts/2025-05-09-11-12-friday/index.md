A little physical therapy retrospective, and strategy shift.<!--more-->

I've now been doing a physical therapy routine daily for nine months. Every time
I sit down to write a post like this I have to go back through my calendar and
figure it out again. I started going to the PT office on July 30th and I did
that biweekly (doing exercises at home on the other days) until about September
last year.

I probably missed three days where I didn't do the exercises at all, I know at
least one of those was on our trip to Death Valley on the tail end of the trip
before we had to drive back to Las Vegas for our flight. But I've otherwise been
extremely consistent.

The routine has changed a bit over time. At first, it was strictly mobility and
stretching, and then my therapist introduced some strength movements and I
started doing those on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday only.

I think the set of movements has gone through a couple of revisions over time,
too, but by and large it's mostly the same stuff. I will list the movements here
for posterity (because I use this blog as a way to keep track of my life).

Every day:

* Torso twists
* Cat/cow (or cat/camel depending who you ask)
* 20x hip lean-back stretches (this has no name as far as I know)
* 2x 30s (per side) "knee to shoulder" hip stretches
* 2x 30s (per side) "figure four" stretches; recently replaced by attempting to
  do a pigeon pose
* 2x 30s hamstring stretch with an exercise strap
* 1x 30s child's pose
* 2x 30s hip adductor ("frog") stretch

On strength days:

* 20x bird dogs (with optional exercise band from hand to opposite foot)
* 30x glute bridges (I experimented with adding weight or increasing distance to
  feet for more difficulty)
* 10x per side "thread the needle"

With some variation, that's what I've been doing. Now I'm changing it.

First off, here is my thinking on the strength portion of my routine.

For a while now, I've suspected that the "strength movements" were not doing
much for me. For starters, they're really easy. This is typical of physical
therapy because the goal is to make you capable of living your regular life,
it's not about athletic performance (even though many athletes need PT).

My physical therapist had told me that the goal is to build these tiny
supporting muscles, so doing harder exercises or using heavier weights might
actually be contrary to the prognosis. Let's set aside for a moment whether that
is even true.

Dr. Sarno, on the other hand, is quick to criticize the perspective that we need
"muscle to support our back" or that the back requires any special treatment at
all. The thesis of his book is that our backs are much more resilient and
capable than modern medicine gives them credit for, and that the idea that your
back can "be thrown out" quite easily, or that we need to sit in specific ways,
or not sit at all, is entirely false.

I don't know who to believe, but it feels like there's at least a grain of truth
in both perspectives. I won't belabor it, but I don't think that doing a bunch
of bird dogs is improving my life, nor do I think I should stop doing physical
therapy altogether.

So, what do? I have decided to keep "thread the needle" because that one has a
stretching component and I moved from the weak-ass version my physical therapist
prescribed to the "hardcore" version you'll see on YouTube. I think that over
time this will continue to benefit me.

I'm dropping the bird dogs and the glute bridges, at least for now. Maybe glute
bridges is something I could re-introduce, or try another variation on
eventually, but for now I'll stop.

Instead of these, I'm going to introduce some climbing-specific strength
training on the three days per week that I normally do it. Probably mainly grip
strength, but also wrist/forearm strength.

We have a few new toys for this. I picked up a Two Stones grip block that has a
few different "tiers" that you pinch, and `$WIFE` added a "portable hangboard,"
which has a 20mm and 15mm slot, as well as a Rogue Fitness "wrist roller."

Today I did a couple rounds of the wrist roller, just rolling up and down with
20 pounds on it, which is extremely hard. And I experimented with holding the
portable hangboard in the 15mm slot with 30 pounds on it, which actually felt
too easy. I can add more weight, but I think I want a block with a 10mm hold, too.

The question is whether to do these on all three days or not, given that I also
have a regular climbing schedule and it's probably not a good idea to have no
time off in between for the hands. I will think about that.
