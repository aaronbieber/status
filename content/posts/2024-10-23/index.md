Sick kid; podcasting; knee update.<!--more-->

### Sick kid

`$KID` has been, let's say "mildly" sick, for several days now, and it seemed to
me that it was just some kind of cold and he'd kick it, but last night he woke
us (at 3:50am of course) because his cough was making it hard for him to sleep.

So off to the doctor he goes this morning to find out if it's possibly *walking
pneumonia*, which is apparently making the rounds (which is parent-speak for "my
kid gave your kid pneumonia").

This disrupts all of our work plans and so forth, but, it cannot be avoided.
Perhaps a little disconnection from work this afternoon can be fruitful.

### Podcasting

In just a few minutes I'll jump into another recording session with my new
podcast collaborator for another "draft" conversation. We're approaching this in
a very "start before you're ready" kind of way, recording the conversations that
we want to have and worrying about things like what the title of the show will
be later on.

I'll be honest, I'm not feeling 100% after being woken in the night, but we
always have a good time in these chats and I'm sure this one will be no
different!

### Knee stuff continues

This left knee is still feeling pretty stiff, and I could only do 90% of my
physical therapy routine. I skipped the movements that are based on flexing the
knee because it definitely still hurts to bend, but it seems to be much less
acute.

I remain *hopeful* that it will be sorted out by Friday, but I'm prepared for the
possibility that it will not be.
