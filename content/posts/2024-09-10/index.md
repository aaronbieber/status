Pixel Watch 3, PT is spinning down, and reflections on yoga.

It's official: my "experiment" to see if wearing a smart watch would give me
insight into... Things... Was a success. If the definition of "success" is
sinking another $400 into it, anyway. I upgraded from the Pixel Watch 2 to the
new 45mm Pixel Watch 3, and I gotta say, it's pretty grand. The larger dial is
perfect for me, a fan of large watches.

I have gotten more out of the sleep tracking than I thought I would (to the
point where I try to wear it to bed every day), and the fitness tracking has
also been super fun to switch on for walks, bike rides, yoga sessions, and for
rock climbing...

I may rock climb again soon! My physical therapist told me today that next week
could be my last session, at least until I make another terrible mistake. Now
I'm in this weird spot where I stepped back for so long that returning is giving
me anxiety. But it is great not to be in pain all the time, how about that?

The yoga class was good, it was intense (for me), but I did all the moves
without re-injuring myself so I'm counting *that* as a win. I intend to pick up
one class a week until I've used up my five-pack and then see how I feel about
it all. We'll see how I feel about it when it's 22 degrees outside. Signs point
to "no thank you."
