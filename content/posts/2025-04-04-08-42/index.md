Anniversary antics!<!--more-->

It's our 10th wedding anniversary, or, well, it was yesterday. I thought it
would be nice to take a day off from work and do stuff together, sans `$KID`,
but we couldn't make it work for yesterday and also taking Friday off is just a
much better option.

Last night we went to dinner with `$KID`, who was so well-behaved I wasn't sure
if he was actually ours for a little bit there. We all had a great meal, `$KID`
had a cheese pizza and vanilla ice cream, `$WIFE` and I shared tuna tartare
and beef carpaccio appetizers and then she had an 8oz filet mignon and I had the
steak frites special.

I avoid red meat, so that was basically my steak for the year. I probably have
one or two steaks in the course of an average year, but this year we didn't go
to a steakhouse for Valentine's Day so maybe this was it. It was delicious, and
worth it.

I just put `$KID` on the bus, so now the day lays before us, rich with
opportunity. The first thing we're going to do is an escape room because we're
giant nerds. We had done another one together before and crushed it, so I'm
looking forward to seeing how we pull it together for this one. It's some kind
of casino espionage theme.

After that I suppose we'll get lunch somewhere, and then who knows! We
purposefully didn't make any other plans.

My back has been a little iffy this week. Obviously I did climb on Wednesday but
I feel like ibuprofen got me through that and it's been a bit tired since then,
giving in to its usual little pinches and prickles. One of my climbing buddies
suggested a night climb tonight but I told him I'd call an audible depending on
how it's feeling.

I think it's good for me to hang back now and then and let things settle.
Hopefully I'll be back in fighting shape for our family climb on Sunday, now
that `$WIFE` has gotten the all-clear from her orthopedist to resume climbing
with her right arm (gradually, safely, of course).
