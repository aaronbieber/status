Some internet finds (Bandcamp Friday!); a day to ride bikes; is it fire pit
season yet?

#### Look and listen

From a recent Veritasium video, I discovered Posy. Watch this mesmerizing,
fascinating, artful piece: [Posy - Motion Extraction](https://youtu.be/NSS6yAMZF78?si=Oyxny-6-ufDymvp9).

It's *Bandcamp Friday* and I promised my picks, so here we go.

* [Magdalene - 1997](https://magdalenevapor.bandcamp.com/album/1997); yeah it's
  vaporwave and I listen to too much of it honestly but this one slaps.

* [Kaya Project - KP06: The Drum & Bass Files](https://sebtaylor.bandcamp.com/album/kp06-the-drum-bass-files);
  Kaya Project is not a new name, but this compilation of DnB/jungle cuts is
  pretty sick.

* [Blooy - Elegies to spring](https://sine-music.bandcamp.com/album/elegies-to-spring);
  random find off the Discover page. Let's call it downbeat electronica? Inspired.

* [DARK DESIRE & GORE - SIREN SONG](https://celadonplaza.bandcamp.com/album/siren-song);
  listen I'm not the one who makes the capitalization choices around here.

#### Go ride a bike

The wife and I are going to bike the whole Minuteman Bikeway today,
out-and-back, which is about 20 miles. It's basically entirely flat and it's
supposed to be beautiful weather today so there's a lot to look forward to.

I'm on the fence about taking my camera, I'm not sure if I'll see anything out
there, but it could be a good experiment to see how it works with the trunk bag,
especially if I secure my lock outside of the pack, which maybe I should do. I
always take the lock even though we never use them.

#### Can I have a fire please?

We're inching toward "fire pit season," which is basically when it gets dark
early enough that I can start, enjoy, and extinguish a fire before like 9pm, but
it still isn't so cold I want to come back inside.

I think one of these next few nights could be it. Tonight seems as good a night
as any, if it isn't too windy. We'll see how the day goes.
