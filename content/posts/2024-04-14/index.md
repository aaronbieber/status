Inspired by Derek Sivers' "[now page](https://sive.rs/now)" which showed up in
the great "[Own Your Web][oyw]" newsletter by Matthias Ott, I am back. It
only took a year.<!--more-->

Since the last time I updated, well, it's been a year so a lot has changed. I
know that these are not "supposed to be" retrospectives, but you can't tell me
what to do.

* I coached full-time for a year and I just wrapped up an ongoing partnership
  that lasted over a year. I never once thought that I'd end up working with one
  client continuously for over a year and it was a great experience.
  
* I took a full-time job writing Go at a company that makes point-of-sale
  software for cannabis dispensaries. I could write many paragraphs about this,
  but I won't. It's great.

* My wife and son and I have been rock climbing (in a gym) steadily for over a
  year now. It's incredible how much progress we've all made.

  We all go at least twice a week, though my wife usually goes a third time. I
  can pretty reliably send V3 boulders and the occasional V4, and 5.10 top-line
  routes and the occasional 5.11 or 5.12 (I have sent only a couple of 5.12s
  ever).
  
* I'm still using Emacs to write prose (like this).

* Photography is going to be a stronger focus for me this year. When it's not
  stupid cold out.

Further bulletins as events warrant.
