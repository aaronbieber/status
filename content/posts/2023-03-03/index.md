I never promised anyone that I would do this every day, but if you've missed me,
know that it warms my heart a little bit.

Things I'm excited about right now:

* It sounds minor, because it is, but I went back to wearing my Omega
  Speedmaster Dark Side of the Moon. It was the first mechanical watch I ever
  bought and I love it, but I haven't worn it in a long time.

* I've gone even deeper into the world of
  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to reformat and expand my 
  [newsletter and podcast](https://thecuriousleader.work) and it feels really 
  good. Hugo is so powerful and so fast. Everything a static site generator should be.

* I now have both dark and light themes set up in Emacs and I learned how to
  override specific faces of a theme to fix little bugs the authors didn't
  predict. It is nice to have things well in order, and attractive. It's also
  nice to be able to fix little problems with relatively low effort.

* I mentioned the podcast in the context of the
  [website](https://thecuriousleader.work), but yeah I started a podcast, and I'm 
  excited about it! I'm excited to use my podcasting microphone (Rode PodMic),
  which I bought for the purpose, and to be completely solo and able to do
  anything I want with it.

That's all for now.
