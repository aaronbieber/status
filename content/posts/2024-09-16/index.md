Reaching a recovery milestone, side-hustles ramp up, home improvements continue.

#### Recovery

I finally climbed again yesterday after four weeks of focusing on physical
therapy and only walking and cycling. Five of us went to Ross Rocks on the CT/RI
border. I was really anxious about going outside for my first time back, but it
went *amazingly* well.

I flashed [Quick Step (5.5)][qs] and [Millipede Arete (5.5)][milli], shockingly
flashed [Double Mantle (5.7)][mantle] (my first outdoor 5.7 send), and sent
[Slippery When Wet (5.8)][slip] after a few tries (my first outdoor 5.8 send!)

A friend brought hammocks, which gave me an awesome way to rest my back between
climbs. While laying in the hammock I went on REI's website and ordered two
hammocks. I'm a hammock person now.

#### Hustles

This week is **busy** for me. I had been doing resume consultations for folks
during the big wave of tech layoffs and someone randomly signed up for one. It's
been probably a year since I marketed it so I don't know where they found the
link, but I'm happy to help.

Sessions with my remaining coaching client pick back up this week after a
few-week hiatus, and then I'm recording the first "pilot" episode of a new
podcast concept I'm developing with a good friend who is also a coach.

#### Home improvement

Since finding a nice guy to do our basement wall removal project, the urge to
hire him to fix all the other things I've been ignoring is strong. I've
contracted with him to replace our back door, which is all rotted out at the
bottom of the jamb and has needed replacement for years.

This feels like the last push of projects before we dip into winter and I go
into *full hibernation mode*.
