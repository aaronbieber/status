I installed shelves and I guess I'm into racing games again?

Yeah it's true I'm unreasonably excited about installing shelving. This is what
happens when you're 43 and a homeowner and one of the primary themes of your
day-to-day is "where am I supposed to put all this stuff?"

We ordered the shelving system from The Container Store. For anyone not
familiar, yes, it's exactly what it sounds like. We have this same system in all
of our closets and we love it.

I do get excited to break out the drill and the level and just *put up some
shelves*. Anyway they look great.

Way back when, I played a lot of Need for Speed on Playstation. I mean, like,
the first Playstation, the original Playstation. It's been a long time since I
played racing games but I apparently fell back into it.

So far I've tried Hot Wheels: Unleashed 2, Inertia Drift, Need for Speed: Deluxe
Edition, and Asphalt Legends Unite.

I'll be honest, Asphalt Legends Unite---which is some kind of gachapon
free-to-play scam for sure---is the most fun of all of them. Hot Wheels is more
unforgiving than you expect from a game named for a child's toy, Inertia Drift
is spartan and unrefined, and Need for Speed is trying very hard to be so much
more than a racing game.

Hot Wheels is still a good challenge, and Need for Speed's graphics are absurdly
good even on the Steam Deck, but Asphalt Legends is just the right level of
casual. There are literally flip ramps, slow-mo cut-ins of your car smashing the
panels off another, lots of drifting, and crazy nitrous boost stuff.

That is all for today goodnight.
