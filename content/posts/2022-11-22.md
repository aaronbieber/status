It was a rather eventful Tuesday. No real breakthroughs on my client-creation
reflections, but I did have three positive interactions today and sometimes
that's all you can really ask for two days before Thanksgiving!

First, I met with the founder and lead of `$PROJECT_PENGUIN` and a bunch of
other coaches and supporting contributors and received a more formal and
specific overview of what's coming down the pipeline there.

The tone of the conversation, as with so many of these groups of coaches, was
quite positive, grateful, and self-aware. Hearing more about the plan excited me
to find a way to get further involved. It certainly could help pay some bills
around here. But mainly, it could be a real thrill.

Then I had a coaching exchange with a fellow CoachU student and gave them an
hour of coaching, which I think went pretty well. They are a bit of a
challenging client in some ways and exchanges are hard because you don't have
the same "skin in the game" as with a proper partnership.

Still, it was good, we reached the goal, and practice is practice.

Finally, I attended the Coaching from Essence Master Coach Program session. My
biggest take-away is that I want to revisit the "levels of creation" and the
"thresholds," which are what hold us back from pursuing our dreams.

The thresholds are:

* Silliness
* Knowledge
* Trust
* Love
* Sanity

Tomorrow is a half-day at school, so I expect to get not much done again, but
progress is progress!
