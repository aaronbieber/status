What is Monday?

I went to bed last night with a mild throat discomfort and got it into my head
that I was getting another cold. Since the kid's been in public school and
everyone has basically stopped masking, it's been like a parade of illness.

I gave myself permission to kind of slack off all day and play video games, and
that was great. Throat started to feel better, drank water, laid low.

In the afternoon I had a coaching exchange chat with a new friend from the
Coaching from Essence community and we ended up not exchanging coaching at all
and instead discussing practice-building. It is always nice to hear from people
who are having similar challenges.

Following that, I had another coaching exchange with a CoachU friend, who
coached me, and I gave what I hope was useful and specific feedback.

In times like those, I wish I actually had a recording of my coaching from
several months ago so I could truly bask in how much I've grown.

Overall, a good day. As far as Mondays go.
