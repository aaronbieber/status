Home improvements, dadding intensifies, and the joy of remote work.

Over the past month we had a useless wall removed in a part of our basement,
which was put there, apparently, just to give the laundry machines a door to sit
behind. It created inaccessible (carpeted!) space that sat empty and wasted. I
hired guys to take down the wall and friends helped put down a floating floor.
It looks amazing.

In that previously inaccessible space I hung three bike hooks for our bikes and
we're going to do installed wire shelves in the remaining space. It will be a
leap in utility for us from what was previously some builder's idiotic decision.

On top of that I found a local guy to service our furnace, which is still
natural gas and desperately needs to be cleaned out. I also found another
company to pick up and wash this area rug that has been slowly turning brown in
our main room for seven years.

Feels great to get all of this stuff dealt with!

The wife is hiking Mount Washington (for some reason) so she'll be gone until
after work tomorrow, which leaves me with The Child. I'm definitely the dad who
treats solo parenting time like a treat, and I also like to treat myself, so
let's see what kind of fun we can get up to.

Last month was my one-year anniversary at my job, which is the first time I've
had an officially fully remote job. God it's so good. I could write a whole
novel about this but it's awesome not to deal with some implicit caste system of
who is or isn't in-person. The company and people are also great, which helps a
lot.
