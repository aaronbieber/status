I contacted my local "handyman" who helped us with our laundry room demolition
and our back door to inquire about fixing up all the cuts through the ceiling
that I made when I put up the ninja gym. Based on a couple of photos, he quoted
me $1,700!!

For $1,700, I could probably hire someone off Facebook to do the whole thing
over again! So my buddy came over yesterday and we started working on it
ourselves. We probably put in less than an hour of work and I feel like it's 80%
done.

Because the anchors slightly move when you swing on them, I think this whole
thing is kind of doomed; the squares of sheetrock around the anchors are bound
to shift and crack along the seams again, but, we'll do our best. I figured
caulk might work best because it can flex, and I can paint over it, but I wonder
if the paint will crack anyway.

At the end of the day I don't think it is going to matter, it doesn't have to
look perfect. So today I need to put more caulk and/or joint compound on the
most deformed ones, hopefully that will work out. There is also another hole I
need to cover up.

On top of that, I've taken down our disused wine rack to make room for more
shelves. I have the actual shelves but I need to 3D print more brackets to match
the other ones in the room. That'll take a little time but isn't a big deal.

I'm looking forward to using my laser level to do the shelves, which is going to
make life so much easier. These shelves will be filled with Lego builds
undoubtedly, as we keep building more and more of these things.

Today is `$kid`'s climbing class, so we'll go have a climb for a while and then
I'll see about tackling these house projects!
