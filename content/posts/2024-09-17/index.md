What Advil can and cannot do, a memoir.

### Physical recovery takes time

I know, that is an obvious statement. I first hurt my back on June 2nd, but it
was not so bad, so I kept climbing twice a week. On July 17 I talked to my
doctor and we tested for arthritis and I committed to physical therapy.

I started PT on July 26th and began doing exercises every day. Then on August
18th, I ignored a fair bit of pain, took a heavy dose of Advil, and climbed
anyway. That was the single dumbest move I've made during this time.

Still, I have not missed a day of PT exercises since the 26th, which puts me at
seven weeks and five days of PT. I do think that the exercises are paying off,
although stretching takes a really long time to work in any noticeable way.

Only this week, now eight weeks into PT, am I feeling like I can climb again.
