Yesterday my back felt about, let's say, 90%? That's not bad, really, and
considering that I climbed hard on Sunday it's *great*. I did go to bed with
some persistent soreness and just hoped that a good sleep would sort me out.

This morning, it's definitely feeling better. I am still waiting for the day
that I can say "it's completely fine," which it has not been in many weeks now,
but I also must face the reality that it may be this way for... A long time.
Hopefully not forever, but potentially months longer.

Tuesday is our other "family climb" day, so unless something drastically changes
that's where I'll be later on. The jury is out on whether it'll be a boulder
projecting day or a toprope day.

I need to bank some more lead practice, so that's a possibility. There are some
newer 5.8-5.9 routes that I apparently haven't climbed, too, and that could be a
lot of fun also.
