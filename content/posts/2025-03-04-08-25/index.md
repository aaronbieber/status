My back is feeling good; I'm going to learn to rappel!<!--more-->

Yesterday my back felt about, let's say, 90%? That's not bad, really, and
considering that I climbed hard on Sunday it's *great*. I did go to bed with
some persistent soreness and just hoped that a good sleep would sort me out.

This morning, it's definitely feeling better. I am still waiting for the day
that I can say "it's completely fine," which it has not been in many weeks now,
but I also must face the reality that it may be this way for... A long time.
Hopefully not forever, but potentially months longer.

Tuesday is our other "family climb" day, so unless something drastically changes
that's where I'll be later on. The jury is out on whether it'll be a boulder
projecting day or a toprope day.

I need to bank some more lead practice, so that's a possibility. There are some
newer 5.8-5.9 routes that I apparently haven't climbed, too, and that could be a
lot of fun also. There's a black 5.11 on the lead wall that I haven't tried yet,
either, so that could be an option.

One of our friends from the gym, who used to work there and used to guide their
outdoor climbing trips, agreed to teach us to rappel, which means... More gear!

Luckily REI just handed out the annual rewards so I picked up a Metolius
personal anchor system (PAS22), a Sterling HollowBlock2 autoblock, and a couple
of Black Diamond screw-lock carabiners, and got them all with the rewards! The
only thing better than gear is *free gear*.
