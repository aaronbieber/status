Last week of work, coaching, climbing stuff.<!--more-->

It's effectively the last week of work until the new year, since I am taking
off Christmas Eve through January first. I am technically working next Monday
but I wonder what will actually be happening since a ton of people will be out.

This week I'm on daytime product support and our big project is entering its QA
phase so I'm sure there will be lots of bugs to fix. Otherwise, I just need to
finish my gift wrapping and maybe make progress on some other household chores.
Feels like a good plan.

In the past couple of weeks I got two submissions to my "get started" form on my
coaching website, and they didn't look like spam, which is always exciting. I
have written back to both folks but haven't heard anything yet. I do think a lot
of people submit the form and then get cold feet. We'll see what happens.

Tonight is our second lead climbing class and I'm still feeling pretty mixed
about the state of my body. I took `$kid` to his climbing class yesterday and
did some belaying and everything went pretty much fine, but I continue to feel
quite fatigued and sore in my lower back.

I feel like I was able to snap back faster several weeks ago and this time it's
just really hanging on. I'm sure there are variables in this equation that I am
not even aware of, and I keep reminding myself that patience is key here.

I mainly want to be able to make the most of the class and really get
comfortable with leading. I ended up buying six Black Diamond quickdraws and I
will bring them tonight, just in case we get a chance to use them.

Depending on how I'm feeling this afternoon I might head down a bit earlier and
work on a 5.11- route that they recently set. I got pretty close yesterday but
was running out of steam and probably should have eaten more, which is a lesson
in itself. I'm sure that I can do it, just need more attempts.
