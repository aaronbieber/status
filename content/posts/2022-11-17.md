I had a client session this morning, which turned into more of a working session
in a shared document, and I struggled a little to balance a coaching approach
with just being my usual opinionated but helpful self. Value was delivered, a
goal was met, and everyone left happy, so this is good.

I did some more work on `$PROJECT_PENGUIN`, which should move into a development
phase shortly. This project has overlap with some other initiatives that could
put me in touch with some high-profile clients (or potential clients) and I'm
excited about what that could mean for me.

I also wrapped up the first draft of the guest post I've been working on for a
friend's tech blog. He had a post get to the front page of Hacker News so he has
quite a few subscribers and I'm excited to get exposure there. The piece is
probably about 60% done but I bet if I give it another eyeball tomorrow I can
shape it up.

Finally, I started editing the podcast we recorded yesterday. I'm still
generally frustrated with managing levels, but it's an amateur podcast so I'm
trying not to get too obsessed about it. Probably need another hour to get that
editing done.

We'll be off to visit friends and family starting tomorrow and through the
weekend, so don't expect updates until Monday.
