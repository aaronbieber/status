Gross blister updates and a PT log.<!--more-->

I put a Band-Aid over the blister (yes, an actual Band-Aid brand bandage) and
then I wrapped climbing tape around that, to make it really stiff. This stops me
from bending the knuckle so far that it compresses the blister. If this is too
much information I don't know why you're still here.

It feels much, much better than it did this morning. When I woke up my hands
felt extremely dry so I'm sure that didn't help, either. At this point I
actually can't tell that it's there, apart from the tape.

It's Friday, and I do an "extended PT" routine on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays. The prescription is to do my two basic mobility movements (torso twists
and cat/cows, also sometimes called cat/camels) and the stretches *every day*,
and then do these additional strengthening movements a "couple times a week"
(which I interpreted to mean three times a week).

The prescribed movements are glute bridges, thread-the-needles, and bird dogs.
I got to a point where I was doing one-leg glute bridges, and bird dogs with a
light duty band between hand and foot.

I'm now also doing thread-the-needles as you might see on YouTube where your
working shoulder goes all the way down to the floor. Originally it was just a
reach-through in mid-air but I'm at a point now where I don't find it difficult
to go all the way down.

Since `$WIFE` decided to buy a couple of small dumbbells for various other
exercises, I started doing glute bridges with the 30-pound one on my hips. That
isn't terribly hard but it's a nice change to the routine.

I even stepped up the band that I use for bird dogs from the one they gave me at
the PT office to the lightest Rogue Fitness band, which is actually quite hard
and probably not the point of the exercise, so I'm not sure if I'll keep doing
that.

In addition to all of the above, I started doing lateral arm raises with a
10-pound dumbbell and some push-ups, which I no longer do routinely since
starting climbing as a primary workout.

Overall this all felt pretty good. I got a bit of a pinch in one direction of
the thread-the-needles, which is sort of my *bellwether* for back health since
it is quite a twisty and tensioned movement, but everything else felt fine.

This marks *day four* of feeling pretty close to OK in the lower back, not
perfect but pretty close, including two back-to-back climbing sessions on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
