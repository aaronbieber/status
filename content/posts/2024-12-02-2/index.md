Today went about as I expected it to.<!--more-->

Spent a lot of the morning poring over Jira---something I hope you never have to
do---and trying to wrap my head around how I could make myself useful. I got
things in a pretty good spot, we had our stand-up, and I ended up running it
(another thing I hate, but am good at).

Then I discovered it. The thing nearly every big software project has. It's that
thing that everyone kind of overlooked until almost the last minute that's
actually a ton more complicated to solve than anyone realized. A lot of my
afternoon was consumed by flogging that issue into submission (ongoing).

I'd rate my back at about 85%. I took Advil twice today and I'm managing; I
can pretty much do what I need to do without pain, so this is pretty minor, but
it's definitely there. I'm a bit anxious about going to the gym tomorrow, but
honestly it'll probably be fine.

I have another night's sleep and another workday ahead before that, and then the
lead class (assuming it *happens*) is at 5pm, which will leave me basically no
time for actual climbing anyway. The class is a lot of learning how to clip the
rope into quickdraws (or the pre-installed lead clips in the gym) and I don't
think it's climbing-intensive.

I need to get my Christmas shopping in order. That's just a thought I had in
this moment.

Three weeks till Christmas break. That's staggeringly close. 2024 is almost
over. What is my 2025 going to be about? Maybe I'll put some words behind that
in upcoming posts.
