Another Saturday is thrust upon us. Here's what's going on in my life.<!--more-->

I've taken to calling this "microblogging," although the posts haven't been all
that micro, have they? I guess it's just a blog. I do give myself permission to
make them short but I never seem to.

The work week was fine, we basically got everything done that we had to, and
next week is going to be a bit of a chaos factory I fear, but probably nothing
that I need to lose sleep over.

I'm trying to tear through my TODOs. I have made a custom "Die Hard" ornament
for our climbing friends, plotted some name cards for gifts on the pen plotter,
and at some point I'll wire up a "Shelly 1" relay for the lights I installed
under the cabinets in my "coffee area" of the kitchen.

I still need to plot the final PTPX postcard and mail them all out. I also need
to wrap `$wife`'s gifts, but I'll do that during work while she's not here.

Otherwise, we just have my buddy's annual Christmas party this evening, which
has become less and less of a spectacle each year as we get older. We are
bringing `$kid` this year, which all but ensures that it's an earlier night, but
I guess that's fine since all of us are climbing in some capacity tomorrow.

`$wife` and her friend are going to attempt to climb outdoors, which at this
time of year I don't think I even want to attempt, so I'm taking `$kid` to his
climbing class and doing some belay practice with my belay buddy. I don't think
there's much else going on tomorrow, which is good, I am feeling a tiny bit
oversubscribed with how much we've committed to this month.

I will return with a [#bookclub](/tags/bookclub) post soon to fill in what I've
already read since the last one.
