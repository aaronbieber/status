It's a Saturday!<!--more-->

Looking back on the week, goddamn, what a shit show, right? Joe fucking Biden
has not even two months to pull himself together and do some seriously
hysterical sabotage. If it were me I'd be in the war room right now planning
what I could do in less than two months to make some attempt to preserve basic
rights for Americans.

But somehow that seems like more than wishful thinking.

#### The weekend

I planned for an uneventful weekend and yet there is much to do. Being an adult
is just saying

> Next month, everything will calm down.

Over and over, until you die.

I have to take down and pack up all the Halloween decorations, change the wife's
windshield wiper blades, finish producing the latest podcast draft recording,
finish my packing list for next week's trip, and hang out with my in-laws who
will suddenly be here in 15 minutes.

I woke up with a sore back, I think I really tweaked something in yoga and would
have been better off not going, but I keep reminding myself that in the end as
long as I'm not actually *injuring* myself, this is all probably good for me.

It makes me a little sad that I may not be able to (or maybe shouldn't) climb
tomorrow. I have so many projects, though.

#### Trip planning

I think I need to buy another bag. Famous last words, I know. Over time I've
really accumulated a lot of backpacks but what I need is that "personal item"
they let you take on the plane in addition to your one luggage piece.

My photography backpack is my luggage piece; it's huge (but fits overhead). What
I want is a smaller bag that I can put my laptop and Steam Deck in, a charger,
my iPad mini... All that stuff I want to play with on the plane.

I guess I should get shopping huh?

Until tomorrow...
