I've been musing on setbacks, persistence, and living from the future.

"Donâ€™t be afraid of failure. Only those who stop failing become a failure in the
end."---*Unknown*

Physical therapy can be a roller coaster ride. One day you're up and everything
feels great, and the next you're down and it feels like the pain will never end.
As with any complex system, the body especially, the important measure is the
*trend*.

This is the same in learning new skills. Anything worth being good at requires
you to be bad at it for a while. Every day that you can't yet do the thing you
want to be able to do is a "mini failure," and a step along the path toward
success.

I'm trying to "live from the future," which is thinking about how you want
things to be when you've reached the other end of the journey and behaving as
though you're already there. In reality, there is no "other end" of most
journeys.

Doing the work, building the habits, staying the course *is the whole point*.
The PT work that I'm doing every day is something that will make me a stronger,
more flexible, more resilient person for the rest of my life. It isn't a stopgap
toward recovery from pain, it's a lifestyle change.

I'm going to be the most flexible guy in my social group. It may take me three
years to get there, but that's the future I'm living from.
