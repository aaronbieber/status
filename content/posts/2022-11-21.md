Kiddo woke up with a low fever this morning, triggering a cascade of routine
changes that basically blew my whole day away. Add to that my festering
commitment to the daily tasks I had laid out previously and you have yourself
the perfect storm of *playing Vampire Survivors for most of the day*.

I had an hour-long phone call with another coach I'm connected to through a
mutual friend and we got into the weeds of building a practice, fees, schedules,
and all that. I'm reaching some new conclusions.

* I need to be having a ton more conversations.

* The strategies I've been using to get conversations are not working.

* Outside of having conversations, I should do whatever else I want to.

Mainly, blogging is cool and I should do it if I like to, but I shouldn't
consider the blog as part of any "funnel," nor should I even think about
funnels. Funnels are stupid.

It is time to reconfigure my entire approach, and re-commit to the new strategy
after Thanksgiving. If I can sketch out something I like in the next two days
I'll feel great about that.

All of my clients and prospects are pushing their calls out till after
Thanksgiving anyway, so I will have some time to think.

More to come.
