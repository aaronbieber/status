Checking in on recovery; so much climbing and driving!<!--more-->

#### Recovery

There hasn't been a day since June that I haven't noticed how my lower back
feels, or had some discomfort even if minor. I am still hopeful that that day
will come, but I'm also grateful to be able to do things.

I felt about 85% for most of yesterday, but we went on a light bike ride in the
afternoon and that felt fine, maybe even helped me feel better. Waking up this
morning, though, it's back to pinching on one side and I just hope that doing
some PT work in a minute is going to ease that (as it typically does).

#### Climbing and driving

Today we're going to go to Quincy Quarries Reservation, which is called "QQ" or
"the Qs" in the climbing community. It's a public park and a lot of people go
there just to walk or picnic or drink (illegally) or whatever. It's a bit of an
iconic climbing location in Boston because of its vertically hewn walls and the
huge amount of graffiti across them all.

Then tomorrow we have the kid's climbing class at 10:30, then straight from
there I think we're driving down to the Connecticut coast to meet up with the
wife's family and stay overnight. Monday is Indigenous Peoples' day so we all
have no work or school.

Then on Tuesday we'll go do our regular family climb in the evening, and me and
our other friend are going to hang back and have our first lead climbing class
from 6-8. The wife has already done the first part also, so now we'll be able to
practice together on Sundays.

Fingers crossed that all of this goes off without a hitch.
