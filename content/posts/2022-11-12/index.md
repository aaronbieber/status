"Solo dadding" day 1 of 5. Watched approximately too much YouTube, went to
Monster Mini-Golf, hit the biggest local playground, and we've got Nacho Libre
queued up for later. It's still early, but I'm going to call it a success.

I also learned about https://yunohost.org ("Y U NO HOST??"), which is tempting
even though I have no need to run any of these services, nor do I actually want
to.

I've been spending a lot of time on Mastodon. Specifically, on
https://indieweb.social, my "home instance." There is so much chatter about the
apparently crumbling bird site and the ins and outs of federation. Today I took
the plunge and joined the Patreon because the admin has had to scale up our
instance a couple times already.

I'm also curious about https://gotosocial.org/, a non-Mastodon ActivityPub
social network server written in Golang. It's alpha and likely buggy and
probably incompatible with certain other services, but it looks simple, which
could be a nice alternative to running a whole Ruby monolith and database server
and so forth.
