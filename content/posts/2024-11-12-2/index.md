I'm unreasonably excited that I was able to move everything from the giant
Shimoda hiking photo backpack into my slick Peak Design 30L backpack. The
Shimoda is more of a "traditional" photo pack in that it opens through the back
so that when you lay it on the ground the part that touches the ground isn't the
part the touches your body, which is very smart.

BUT, the Shimoda is huge. It's designed for hiking so it has really thick,
comfortable straps, and a massive waist strap with well-padded side pieces...
But I am not intending to do any insane hikes on this trip so I feel like it's
overkill. It's also great that it's weather-proof, but if it rains in Death
Valley it'll be the end times so who cares?

I guess I'm mainly railing against the size. Is that reasonable? Should I even
care? Other things that might matter:

* I can't "really" use the Capture clip on the Shimoda straps. I made a very
  kludgy Velcro "solution" to attach it, but it's not in a great spot and it
  isn't how the clip is meant to be used.

* The Shimoda has two much larger water bottle pouches on the sides?

* The Shimoda has a ton of space left in the roll-top for things like clothes.

I just don't know if it's worth hauling this huge mostly empty bag just in case
I am going to go on a multi-mile hike and I want to shed a layer and stow it in
the top. Then again, if we're going to go on any multi-mile hikes, I should
probably bring the Shimoda rather than the Peak Design.

Then again do I need to bring all of my camera gear on a multi-mile hike? I
would definitely bring _a camera_, but do I need _all of my cameras_?
