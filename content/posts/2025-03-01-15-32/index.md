The first real "boys' climbing night" happened, and it was good.<!--more-->

#### Send log

I had attempted this new yellow 5.10 at the end of my previous session but was
too tired to get through it. Flew up it this time, and then sent these other new
manual belay routes.

The 12- is nowhere near a 12. I flashed them all.

One of my friends was doing some attempts on a pretty fun blue 5.11 that I had
done before so I victory lapped that one (twice), and then both of my friends
were taking turns on a pretty spicy pink 5.10 that I also had done, so I victory
lapped that one a couple of times as well.

Same for a blobby/slopey pink 5.10. Not difficult with my height advantage.

For kicks, I also victory lapped a crimpy yellow 5.11 on the lead wall just to
see if I could still do it (I can). I think I flashed it the first time, too,
which blew my mind at the time because it's quite crimpy.

#### Boys' climb

I got together on Friday with two of my climbing friends, one whom we've been
climbing with for a while, and another that we haven't seen in probably over a
year. It was cool to get out and climb with just the two guys, and also to be
probably the strongest climber among us, at least at the moment.

One buddy was the guy who took a long fall and he's still recovering and getting
back into it, and the other has been back to climbing for only a couple of
months. I was just flying up routes like a madman, and it was pretty fun.

After we toproped for a while we returned to the boulders. The guy who has just
come back to climbing doesn't really like bouldering so we were playing on some
lower-grade stuff and I was trying to give him some tips.

At the very end I attempted a new purple V5 but it has a blind last move pretty
high up and I'm just not into that so I gave up.

Then I did a few attempts on my yellow project V5 and made a lot of progress. I
almost, *almost* sent it, but I was pretty tapped out and missed the last hold
by an inch or two. This gave me huge confidence that I will be able to finish
it. It's a very challenging/powerful one for sure!
