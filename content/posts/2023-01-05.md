I tested negative for covid today!!

I guess that would be the headline, if there was going to be one. I'm still not
feeling back to 100%, and it's hard to put my finger on what is wrong, but a
negative test is a meaningful move in the right direction here.

My throat and sinuses are still feeling a bit shredded, and I'm more tired than
I feel like I ought to be, but all of my taste and smell are back and everything
else is good.

I had a reasonably good coaching session this morning and checked off all the
boxes on my daily todo list. I am trying "morning pages" now, and today was day
two, and it is going okay.

I have also implemented a morning "tech-free walk," which is an idea from Sahil
Bloom's "Curiosity Chronicle" newsletter. Today I did the first one, right after
dropping the kid at the bus stop, and though it was damp and misty and gross,
the walk was good.

I had planned to parlay the walk into picking up the library book I have waiting
for me but our library doesn't open until 9am, so that nixed that plan.

I also managed to do a little bit of piano practice, though if I'm being honest
it's a bit frustrating at this stage and I'm not totally in love with this Easy
Piano app. I already accidentally paid for a year of it, though, so I'm going to
try to see it through.
