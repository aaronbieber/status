The new year has begun; what does it have in store for me?<!--more-->

Every year for the past few years I've completed this [annual wrap-up][wrap]
exercise, which is a structured approach to looking back on the past year and
forward to the next. Credit to my friend Oren for the original version, and
check out his coaching app [Telos][telos] as well.

One of the things you're guided to do in this exercise is create a motto for
yourself for the upcoming year. This year, I landed on *"Choose the hard thing;
one step at a time."*

This motto is meant to remind me that I can do hard things, and I like to
accomplish hard things, but sometimes I need a nudge. I also have a tendency to
get overwhelmed by things I want to do, and the "one step at a time" part is
meant to remind me that any small step toward that goal is valuable.

It's my intention this year not to shy away from hard things, even if they may
be frightening, and to more fully embrace the notion that growth happens at our
edges, and with some discomfort. World-famous big wall climber Tommy Caldwell
learned this from his father, who would call those kinds of adventures "type two
fun."

"Type one fun" is just fun; it's watching a comedy or playing a game. "Type two
fun" is uncomfortable, painful even, but has a big payoff. Something like
climbing a difficult wall or changing a deeply ingrained habit. There is also a
"type three fun," which is simply not fun at all. Why endure the distress if
there is no reward?

I don't yet have a very clear picture of what kinds of "type two fun" I may get
up to this year, but I have a pretty strong sense that I'll know them when I see them.

Here's to "becoming a more terrifying version of yourself" in 2025!
