It sure has been a week. My head is spinning from the election and a couple of
rather high-intensity work days where I had to sign on at like 5am to deploy
some disruptive stuff. It failed the first time because I didn't prepare enough,
and the second time I had a couple of bugs and had to "fail forward" and it was
annoying and took longer than anticipated.

On top of that I'm on our daytime support rotation and after-hours on-call.
There are virtually zero after-hours pages at this place (knock on wood) but
support issues flow in all day every day and one of my responsibilities is
looking after bugs that pop up, which has been distracting and kind of
exhausting as well.

I did yoga last night and it went pretty well. I like this instructor because
she runs pretty chill vinyasa flow with a lot of warm-up and an approachable
number of challenging movements and a really generous Shavasana at the end. This
one did push my sprained knee and my back a little, I really tried to be gentle
with it, but I can't help but think it may have irritated things somewhat.

It's the Friday before a long weekend, and we don't have a ton of plans for the
weekend yet, but I think it'll be nice to have relatively few "scheduled
activities." I have no idea what we're going to do on Veteran's Day.

Today I need to make progress on my next substantial work project, complete my
packing list, and... Maybe that's all I want to commit to.

Carry on.
