Starting the day with a heating pad; Boston Brutalism Tour 2024.

I'm backfilling yesterday's status from my new morning spot. Since my back
injury, I have really liked starting the day with a heating pad on it. My PT
would give me some heat before doing the exercises in the office, and it really
does make it feel better. It also just feels nice generally.

I used to come downstairs, get a cup of coffee, and sit at my desktop computer
in my office. Now, for the past couple of months, I come down and lay on the
heating pad on the couch with my Framework laptop. I quite like this laptop.

"Boston Brutalism Tour 2024" finally happened, and went altogether very well! My
friend's husband, who is an architect by training, joined in and shared his
collected anecdotes about the construction and materials and so forth and we all
had a great time walking almost five miles through Boston.

I got some interesting photos, but I also discovered that many of them that I
shot with the 35mm Fuji prime lens are very soft, even at f/16. I need to get to
the bottom of that because it's the opposite of what I expected.

I shot a lot of infrared, though, and those seemed like the winners of the day
overall.
