Climbing at the Qs (send log)!<!--more-->

#### Sends

{{< sends >}}

Okay, so Quincy Quarries ("the Qs," or "QQ") is pretty wild. You can
look it up, there are lots of photos online. I had dropped by there previously
to take some photos so I knew what it was like as a place, but had never climbed
there.

But climbing there is pretty cool, the walls are basically granite that is left
over from what used to be a quarry (perhaps obviously enough) and they're just
straight hewn with fun roofs and jags and whatnot. I'd say it's as interesting a
spot as Ross Rocks.

I sent "M Weave" (5.6), "Wanderlust" (5.7), "Hang Left" (5.8), and "Layback
Corner" (5.8), and then we set this weird slab that was in the book we brought
but is for some reason not on Mountain Project called "M Corner" (5.5).

*M Weave* was simple and I flashed it. *Wanderlust* was trickier but I also
flashed it. *Hang Left* took me two tries but I would say it was not terribly
challenging. "Layback Corner" has a really tough start, but the wife and another
of our friends worked on it and found a nice beta that looked promising.

On my attempt... I flashed it.

The 5.5 that was only in the book was super crazy, definitely felt way harder
than 5.5. It was probably graded 40 years ago before the wall was eroded and
then covered in shiny graffiti. Still flashed it though!
