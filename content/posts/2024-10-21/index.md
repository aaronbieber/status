A send and a sprain; a fun (early) morning.<!--more-->

#### A send and a sprain

As far as my back injury I've been doing *great*. I climbed on Friday, we did
the ropes course on Saturday, and I climbed again yesterday.

I flashed a "5.11+" but it felt like a 5.10 to be honest. Maybe a stiff 10, but
definitely not an 11+. My on-sight grade is about 5.10; I've only flashed one or
two 5.11s ever.

I have three remaining 5.11 projects in the gym, and after the wife and another
of our gym buddies sent a purple one, I had a go, and I badly twisted my knee.
This is just more proof that one person's beta doesn't work for another, and I
guess a reminder that I'm a frail old man.

It didn't feel great, I took a break and belayed the wife for a bit, and then I
did have it within me to "victory lap" the orange 5.11 that I had done on
Friday, proving that I can definitely do it. That felt awesome because that
climb seemed so impossible the first few times I tried it.

The knee is much worse today, it is very solidly sprained. I can walk and stand
on it, but bending it hurts. "Vitamin I," ice, and rest is required.

#### Fun (early) morning

I had to get up a bit earlier this morning to do an off-hours production deploy,
but as luck (?) would have it, our burglar alarm went off at 3:20am and got me
out of bed. It was a false alarm because I had shoddily taped the door sensors
to our new/old door that is going to be replaced again anyway.

Serves me right for thinking that simple double-sided tape would hold. After
resolving that whole scene, I basically couldn't sleep anymore. I did all the
New York Times puzzles and tried to sleep, but basically just laid in the dark
until around 4 and got up to do the work stuff.

The deploy went without issue, so I took some time to screw the door sensors
in so they wouldn't come off again, and then I edited the "rough cut" of the
podcast project I'm working on.

A productive, if somewhat annoying, morning.
