Feeling pretty good this week. On the whole, anyway.<!--more-->

`$WIFE` climbed Sunday and yesterday so she didn't want to climb today, and
`$KID` has pre-team Mondays and Wednesdays, so I was going to go by myself and
meet up with `$BELAY_BUDDY` tonight, but she's nursing a hurt finger from our
climb on Sunday, so I elected not to go at all.

Honestly, I was feeling really not amazing this morning, I don't know why, and
if I was at the gym right now I am not sure if I'd be having a great time. I'm
developing a headache and I think maybe I'm fighting off some minor cold or
something.

But nevertheless, my back is feeling pretty great today. Like 98%. Maybe the
best it's been in three or four weeks. And *that*, friends, is worth
celebrating. It is making me wonder openly if these supplements are actually
doing something because things did seem to spin in a positive direction a bit
more rapidly since I started taking them.

Of course, I also neglected to take my regular multi-vitamin for a long time and
resumed when I implemented the supplement regimen, so there are far too many
variables here to call this objective in any way. Still, the timing is pretty coincidental.

The plan now is to solo climb during `$KID`'s pre-team practice tomorrow, since
I have to be there anyway. They set new boulders between Monday and Tuesday so
there will be a bunch of new stuff, too. If tomorrow feels the same as today,
physically, I think it could be very satisfying.
