Thinking a lot about note-taking and idea-management again, and struggling with
putting a lot of my goals on pause.

#### Pain

It's normal for physical discomfort to crowd out other, broader thoughts. It's
challenging to dream about the future when your present is dominated by chronic
pain. I'm improving, to be sure, and the time scale we're talking about here is
on the order of weeks to months, not years, but it's not any less real in my
head.

What makes it more of an acute challenge is how dramatically I've personally
leaned into physical activities as hobbies or outlets, and having that suddenly
vanish from my day-to-day has been a real adjustment. This is the third week
since the "big flare-up" that really floored me, and I'm only just starting to
feel oriented in this.

I've been able to do some bike rides, but I haven't been climbing, and I was
just about to make a dive into longer/harder hikes and all of that is suddenly
and entirely on hold. The suddenness and completeness of the change is jarring.

Physical therapy continues to help and I know it's a long journey but day by day
there are small improvements and that's all I can hope for or count on.

#### Zettels and stuff

I'm still using Logseq often, but probably not often enough. I'm embarking on a
new project, which I'll announce when I'm ready to, but it requires some light
research and pulling together a rolling corpus of topics and content, which is
basically what Logseq was conceived for.

This has re-ignited my interest in stuff like the zettelkasten method, "second
brain," and things like that. I occasionally fall down the rabbit hole of
collating notes and suddenly it feels like a productive interest again.

All of this is also the reason I've started updating this space again. More to
come!
