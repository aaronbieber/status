Climbed some shit, wrote some shit, recorded some shit.<!--more-->

#### Sends

First of all, *we passed the lead climbing test!!* I now have a "LEAD" tag on my
harness that lets gym staff know that I understand how to safely lead climb, and
I can freely lead in any of our gym's locations. Let the practice begin.

After passing the test, we stayed on ropes for the whole time, and I got a send
train going.

 - White 5.8 (flash)
 - White 5.9 (flash)
 - Blue 5.10 (flash but a little sketchy)
 - Green 5.10 (flash)
 - Yellow 5.11 (flash, crimpy)

None of these routes had been graded yet and I'm pretty amped to say that I
underestimated the grade on basically all of them. I can see how the two 10s are
10s in retrospect, but the 11 surely felt more like a 10 to me.

#### Acts of creation

Meanwhile, I have been keeping up a daily writing habit in the hopes of
generating interest for my coaching practice. I need to come up with a strategy
for connecting all of this to some kind of a pitch, and the time is starting to
feel right to do that.

I've been posting mainly on LinkedIn and then syndicating on my own sites when
the piece seems lengthy or thoughtful enough. This has generated a ton of
LinkedIn engagement, but you can't really pay the bills with engagement, can
you? I have dropped the occasional note about my availability, but I think I
need to post a for-real ad like once a week or something.

My podcast partner and I have been recording podcasts every couple of weeks. We
just resumed post-holidays and recorded our fifth episode. I still have to edit
it, but I think we're getting close to the point where we can publish them.

We're still workshopping a "tag line" or "intro," so after that's squared away I
think we can go public!
