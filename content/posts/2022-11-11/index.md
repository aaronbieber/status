Ah, Veteran's Day. Schools are closed on Veteran's Day, which means that not
much else *gets done*.

That's fine, though. Sometimes you just have to drive down to Providence and go
to the Roger Williams Park Zoo and eat too much macaroni and cheese and ride a
carousel with your son, and what better way to spend a Friday, really?

My newfound mission statement has been swirling in my head, banging up against
other thoughts, occasionally chipping some paint off of previous ideas I had for
how to market my practice, and that's a good thing.

It feels really good to say it, because it gives everything else a sense of
*meaning*, and I think it is the closest I've come to a broader *reason* why I
would want to actually do this.

To recap, why do I actually want to do this? Coaching, that is?
   
 * It is satisfying. Helping people feels good already, but helping people to
   help themselves feels even better, and being appreciated for adding value
   individually is the best.
 
 * I'm good at it. People have come to me for guidance throughout my
   professional career and they've always left satisfied. Since studying the ICF
   brand of coaching skills, I've only gotten *better*.

 * Building my own way of being and creating value, as an entrepreneur, gives me
   immense, almost immeasurable freedom. I'm still figuring out how to use it.
   
 * Here's the new one: coaching curious, empathetic engineering managers is
   activism. My client selection process and my work creating leverage and
   impact for those selected individuals is a very real shot across the bow of
   the ladder-climbing, OKR-chasing, optics-obsessed managers I hate.

That's the key right there. I've worked for a few awful people. I love the idea
that my work makes theirs harder to do, by squeezing them out. I believe that
curious, empathetic managers are more effective and more well-liked, and in the
end, that wins.

I'm realizing now that for just a moment, I had put a line like "the world
doesn't need more bad managers" on my website, but later took it down.

I took it down because it felt too negative... But I think, in that moment, I
knew exactly what I was doing. I just hadn't connected all the dots yet.
