We were down in Connecticut over the weekend for "second Christmas" with my
in-laws, which was a grand time. I've watched as both families (mine and
`$wife`'s) have gotten progressively more sober, which is really interesting to
see.

We should have brought a couple edibles but totally forgot, so it was a
completely sober weekend. `$wife` had a lot of trouble sleeping, which meant
that my sleep was interrupted, too.

Then off to the climbing gym for `$kid`'s class. Just worked on boulders today.
All the new ones lacked start/finish labels and grades, though they put them in
the Pebble app so we could find the grades that way at least.

I sent a new white V4, which starts with a mild dyno followed by a totally
cut-loose one-handed grab into a small crimp, then a back flag into a second
smaller crimp. Pretty spicy for a V4, took me several tries. I can usually get
V4s in one or two.

Spent most of the time projecting a new green V5 that's super powerful. I got
pretty far on it so I think it'll go next time, if my back cooperates. My back
is currently *not* cooperating.

We finished the latest season of *What We Do in the Shadows* and then realized
we never watched the previous season of *Star Trek: Lower Decks*, so we're
powering through that now. It's such a good show, especially for fans of the
earlier shows. They're always referencing subtle lore across all of them and
it's charming and hilarious.
