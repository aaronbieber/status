My semi-obsession with brutalism, the trials and tribulations of product
management, and a return to coaching.

#### Brutalism

I'm someone who thinks that Boston City Hall is magnificent. I get that it may
not be "pretty" to most, but I love its looming, monolithic, mid-century angles
and unrelenting mass.

I've [photographed it][ch], as well as the late [Government Center garage][gcg],
another stunning example of geometry in cement. I even enjoy the term
"brutalism." It sounds like what it means; these structures are neither kind nor
deferential, they offer no flourish or subtlety, they are simply brutal, and I
love them for that.

Boston is cited as the "most brutalist" city in the United States, and I live
right next to it, so it occurred to me that I have this treasure trove of
beautiful brutalist structures just sitting there waiting to be photographed.

I called in some help from an architect friend of mine, scoured the many
articles written on the subject, and compiled a list of what turns out to be,
give or take, about fourteen buildings that I felt were interesting enough to be
the subject of some art.

I'm going to head downtown on Saturday and visit a couple, or a few, and see
where it takes me. Unless it rains.

#### Product managers love meetings

Why does this feel like such a truism? That product managers enjoy talking about
work more than actually doing it? Why is it always the product manager that
has to invite ten people to a meeting for ninety minutes that ends up running
past the two-hour mark?

I don't know the answers to these questions, but if you do, give me a shout.

#### Still coaching

Yup I'm still doing it. I have only one client right now, but they've been
working with me for longer than a year, which is much longer than I ever
expected that anyone would continue their work with me. It's probably closer to
two years than it is to one at this point.

Surely I enjoy helping people, but what's rewarding about coaching is how I am
able to help people to help themselves, and create lasting change that carries
them forward through their future challenges, even if I'm not there.
