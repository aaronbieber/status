Decent climbing day today!<!--more-->

We went to South Boston today with the whole crew and while I didn't feel the
strongest ever, I did send a bunch of fun stuff. Did just a little toprope
today.

Took a few attempts at the orange 5.10 I couldn't do last time but failed again.
This is a very spicy 5.10. Also took some attempts at the black 5.11 and yellow
sloper 5.11 but didn't get far on either.

All in all, a decent climbing day. Back started getting a little angry with me
in the latter half but I think I'm still hanging in there. Focus on PT and rest
and PT tomorrow.
