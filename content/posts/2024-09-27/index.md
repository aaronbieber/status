I'm not sick that often, but I'm sick now; Boston Brutalism Tour 2024 is
actually happening.

It's been a while since I've been, like, actually sick. Woke up this morning
with a sore throat, probably picked up the bug the wife just got over, or maybe
some other bug, who knows.

I spent most of the day kind of laying around, watching YouTube, exploring
Bandcamp, fooling with my Logseq queries, and playing Asphalt Legends Unite.

Bandcamp Friday is *next* Friday, so I wanted to see if I could queue up some
artists of interest to pick up when it comes around. No revelations yet.

I had a photography outing on the books for tomorrow with a friend, and I roped
her into doing "Boston Brutalism Tour 2024" instead of whatever we were
previously going to do. I'm psyched to go see if I can make some art out of
these structures.

I'm going to bring both the regular camera (Fuji X-T5) and my infrared camera
(Fuji X-T4). It's supposed to be a bright, sunny day tomorrow so the conditions
might be almost perfect for this.

Other than that, it's going to be a "normal" weekend.
