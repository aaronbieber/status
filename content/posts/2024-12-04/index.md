Lead class; podcasting; Christmas; and more!<!--more-->

#### Lead class

Finally, *finally*, after weeks of runarounds and rescheduling, my friend and I
had our first lead class at our gym on Tuesday night. It was a really good
experience and I have a very clear sense now of how challenging lead climbing
is. I'm looking forward to doing more practice.

My back is still not 100% though, so I'm trying to be really ginger with it and
get back to full functionality by Sunday, which is the next time I will climb.

Meanwhile, a climber that we don't know very badly injured himself in an
accident out on a local crag and the news made the rounds. I think he was sport
climbing, so that's a reminder of how important it is to concentrate on safety.

#### Podcasting

I recorded another podcast conversation this morning with my coach friend and I
think it went pretty well. This is probably at least the fourth one that we've
recorded. We still have no title. I think we're starting to figure out what
kinds of topics are working so a title will probably emerge from that at some
point.

It's been nice to have a little collaborative side project.

#### Christmas!

We finally put up the tree today and decorated it. While tidying the kitchen
earlier I discovered that we still had this unopened bag of cannabis-infused hot
chocolate mix, so I made us a couple mugs of that stuff and we listened to
Mannheim Steamroller while setting up the tree.

Our tree-topper is, naturally, a sta---no, it's actually _Deep Space 9_, the
space station. I found a model somewhere and 3d printed it, but it's kind of
warped and it might be time to try again with my much nicer printers.

#### And more!

I kind of can't believe it's Wednesday night already. I feel like the week is
flying by, even though my work days have been pretty intense (by the standards
of my very relaxed job).

Looking forward to a hopefully longer night's sleep tonight. Ta for now.
