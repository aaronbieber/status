Started the day off right: overslept, then forgot to take the kid to his swim
lesson. I blame the severe change in routine of being in "solo dad" mode and
feeling, well, a little overwhelmed.

The highlight of the day was a trip to the Launch trampoline park, at which the
boy and I both did a respectable amount of jumping. It's great fun and great
exercise, though not cheap by any means.

The remainder of the day has been spent at home, sheltered from the seemingly
endless rain and dropping temperature. We've watched a prodigious amount of
YouTube, and I discovered (and subsequently became mildly addicted to) [Vampire
Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/), which
plays flawlessly on the Steam Deck.

The one #til that I have for today is that I implemented the [tags](/tags) index
and [wtf?](/wtf) page on this site, and in so doing I discovered a bit more
about how taxonomies work in Hugo. The layout lookup cascade remains almost
impenetrably too flexible, but once you get the hang of it it's very powerful.

I'm ready to be returned to my regularly scheduled programming tomorrow.
