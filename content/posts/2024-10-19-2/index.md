Adventure recap; whatever else is going on.<!--more-->

### Adventure recap

So we did Boundless Adventures. The weather turned out to be absolutely
gorgeous. It was like 35 degrees this morning and I was concerned that it would
still be chilly and brought a hat and thick fleece, but by the time we got there
it was in the 60s and sunny and it felt fabulous.

The kid is seven years old, which is the minimum age for the place. He is
allowed to do the yellow (easiest) courses by himself, and the green ones
(intermediate) with at least one parent accompanying.

We ended up doing, I think, two greens and three yellows. The yellows all pretty
much went fine, but the second green that we did was the *hardest green* that
they have (there are three), and the kid kind of broke down on an obstacle that
was really tough and the swinging wood beams that you're supposed to hold onto
kept banging into his head and I think he was just a little too tired and
overstimulated.

Other than that, though, we all had a really good time, and I think five courses
in a day, especially for a seven-year-old, is quite admirable. When the wife and
I went last year, we did every single course, and it was exhausting for sure.

### Whatever else?

We are doing a family photo shoot at the school this evening, which is organized
by the PTO. Then I think after that we're going to get Indian food. I'm pretty
excited to have some good curry and some garlic naan.

Tomorrow the kid has his climbing class and then after that we have a Halloween
party, which will be our first chance to put on our Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler
(from Jurassic Park) costumes. You gotta love a costume that's basically just
clothes.
