I get such a dry mouth overnight when I've had a little cannabis.<!--more-->

Woke up at like 2am desperately needing water, so naturally I did not fill up my
bedside water bottle, because why would I do that, that would make too much
sense.

Staggered into the bathroom and filled it up with our disgusting hard water. I
normally only fill it with filtered water because the minerals in our water
smell and taste horrible (by comparison anyway).

Feeling overall pretty good today though. The back feels alright I think. Today
is a "real rest day" and then we'll go climbing tomorrow at South Boston, where
I have *unfinished projects*.
