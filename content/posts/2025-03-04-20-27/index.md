Sent my first V6!<!--more-->

Today was a pretty beige day in terms of work and everything else, but Tuesday
night is "family climb" and somehow my back has been feeling okay with this
frequency, so I took a couple of ibuprofen for the subtle aches and got down
there.

A few of our buddies were there, so I played on some lower-grade boulders and
shared some beta and that kinda thing. `$WIFE` has been working on a really
difficult V6 and she's very close on it.

I had been poking around on this blue V6 on Sunday, and `$WIFE` and her belay
buddy both sent it. After figuring out how to start it, which seemed like the
hardest part, I had some confidence that it could be possible.

It has a tricky low start that traverses to the right onto small crimps, then a
switch to a big pinch and it's basically large pinches all the way up. It's
fairly technical and requires the grip to stay on the pinches.

I got the first couple moves down, so in this session I really worked on the
transition from the crimps to the first pinch, which is honestly the hardest
part of the whole problem. I got that figured out to a point I felt pretty good
about and rested a while.

Once I was feeling pretty rested I went for another attempt and it just started
to fit together. `$WIFE` was calling up to me, "You got it!" I moved all the way
through up to the top, one move from the end. "Go for it, it's good!" I heard
`$WIFE` yell. The last move is pretty big, I went for it, I got it!

It felt pretty awesome to be topping out on my first ever V6.
