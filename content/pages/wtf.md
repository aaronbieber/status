## What the Flip?

This is [Aaron's](https://aaronbieber.com) current status, which is designed to
evoke the spirit and style of the [Name/Finger
protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(protocol)) of the 1970s and
'80s.

The content is somewhere between status update, diary, and "today I learned,"
and I intend to experiment with what works for me and use tags to differentiate.

Ultimately, I write this for myself, to help me crystallize what happens every
day (or most days) and I post it on the internet because I believe in "learning
in public." Nothing I write here is *intended* to be valuable to anyone else,
though I hope some of it is.

This site is statically generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which is so far
my longest-running favorite static site generator.
