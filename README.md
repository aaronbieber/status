# Aaron's Status

This is a quick and dirty retro-styled daily status diary that is meant to evoke
the use and appearance of the "finger servers" of the early days of the
Internet, back when we used to capitalize Internet.

It's a Hugo blog, nothing fancy. I don't see any reason why anyone would want
this for anything, but if reviewing the configuration is useful for you, have at
it.
